Please give it a whirl and let us know what you think.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of large source code repositories is always interesting, especially over long periods of time. Fun and useful to see various characteristics by language, who was actively contributing in a project, or when activity peaked. After coming across [blessed](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib), we knew we had a quick way visualize the analysis with no fuss or complications.\r\n\r\nTarget audience is other developers or consumers of development projects. Easy to glean more information about a project by looking at the source from a high-level viewpoint.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies for manual installation\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf using the `-viz` option, you'll need to have [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) installed.  `bron` expects the `blessed-contrib` src directory to be a cousin to the `bron` src directory.\r\n\r\nFor example if your `bron` src directory is located at:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/go/src/github.com/gophergala/bron\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen your `blessed-contrib` src directory should be located somewhere like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/go/src/github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installing `blessed-contrib` be sure and copy over the dashboards directory from `bron` like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncp -R dashboards ../../yaronn/blessed-contrib/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Automated installation methods\r\n\r\n#### Run on Nitrous:\r\n\r\n[![Hack gophergala/bron on Nitrous](https://d3o0mnbgv6k92a.cloudfront.net/assets/hack-l-v1-d464cf470a5da050619f6f247a1017ec.png)](https://www.nitrous.io/hack_button?source=embed&runtime=go&repo=gophergala%2Fbron)\r\n\r\n#### Run on Docker:\r\n\r\nNote, the Docker image (from the Hub or from source) will already include all of the above mentioned dependencies, so you can skip those steps.\r\n\r\nGet it from the Docker Hub:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker pull tubesandlube/bron\r\ndocker run -it bron -h\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, build it yourself:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gophergala/bron.git\r\ncd bron\r\ndocker build -t bron .\r\ndocker run -it bron -h\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Install using Go:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo get github.com/gophergala/bron\r\nbron -h\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using Docker Volumes to Persist Results\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it -v /home/go/src/github/gophergala/bron/db:/go/src/github.com/gophergala/bron/db bron -viz\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
